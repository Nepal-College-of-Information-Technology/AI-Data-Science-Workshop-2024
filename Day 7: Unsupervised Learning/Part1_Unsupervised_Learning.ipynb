    "# Part 1: Introduction to Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the **theoretical background** of **unsupervised learning** and explain the differences between unsupervised and supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data **without labels**. The model tries to find hidden patterns, structure, or relationships in the data, without being told explicitly what the correct output should be. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- No labeled data is provided (no input-output mapping).\n",
    "- The goal is to discover the underlying structure of the data.\n",
    "- Common unsupervised learning tasks: **Clustering** and **Dimensionality Reduction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Real-World Examples:\n",
    "- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on buying behavior for personalized marketing.\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting unusual patterns in data that may indicate fraud or system errors.\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Grouping users by behavior to make recommendations (e.g., Netflix or Amazon).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering vs Classification: Unsupervised vs Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning (Classification):\n",
    "- **Labeled Data**: In supervised learning, the dataset has labels (i.e., each data point has an associated output). \n",
    "- **Goal**: The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Spam detection, image classification, sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering):\n",
    "- **Unlabeled Data**: In unsupervised learning, the dataset does not contain labels. The model must identify patterns in the data.\n",
    "- **Goal**: The goal is to group similar data points together into clusters or reduce data dimensions while preserving meaningful information.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Grouping customers, document clustering, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In **supervised learning**, if we have a dataset with features of fruits (size, color, shape) and their labels (apple, orange, banana), the model is trained to predict the correct fruit label for any new input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Train the model** with input-output pairs.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate** the model on new, unseen data (using accuracy, precision, etc.).\n",
    "3. The goal is to predict correct labels for new data based on patterns learned from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In **unsupervised learning**, if we have a dataset of fruits with features (size, color, shape), but without any labels, the model will try to group similar fruits together (clustering). It wonâ€™t assign specific labels (like \"apple\" or \"banana\"), but it will try to group the fruits based on their similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Train the model** on the data without labels.\n",
    "2. The model will try to find **clusters** or **groupings** of similar data points.\n",
    "3. The goal is to discover patterns in the data, not to predict a specific label.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Unsupervised Learning Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No need for labeled data**: Labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Unsupervised learning can work with large amounts of unlabeled data.\n",
    "- **Discover hidden patterns**: It can reveal underlying relationships or patterns in data that we might not have been aware of.\n",
    "- **Data exploration**: Unsupervised learning is used in exploratory data analysis to gain insights from raw data before applying more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Clustering algorithms group similar data points together into clusters based on certain characteristics.\n",
    "   - Common algorithms: **K-Means Clustering**, **Hierarchical Clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
    "   - Reducing the number of input features in the dataset while retaining the most important information.\n",
    "   - Common algorithms: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **t-SNE**.\n",

    "- **Supervised learning** requires labeled data and predicts an output based on learned patterns.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** works with unlabeled data and aims to discover patterns or groups in the dataset.\n",
    "- Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.\n",
