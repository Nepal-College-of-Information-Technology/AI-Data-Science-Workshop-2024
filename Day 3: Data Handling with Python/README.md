# Day 3: Data Handling with Python

**Goal**: Introduce students to data manipulation using Python with a focus on using Pandas and NumPy for handling datasets.

---

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to NumPy**:
   - What is NumPy and why is it useful for numerical operations.
   - Creating arrays and performing operations (addition, mean, standard deviation).
   - Real-world examples of using NumPy for calculations.
   
2. **Introduction to Pandas**:
   - What is Pandas and its importance in data manipulation.
   - Creating DataFrames, reading and writing CSV files.
   - Filtering, sorting, and performing statistical operations on datasets.

3. **Basic Statistical Operations**:
   - Performing basic statistical functions such as mean, median, and standard deviation using Pandas.
   - Data manipulation with Pandas (filtering and sorting).
   - Real-world example: Using Pandas to handle Nepali student records and analyze city-specific data.

## Activities

1. **NumPy Exercise**:
   - Task: Create arrays and perform basic mathematical operations.
   - Example: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for a list of numbers.

2. **Pandas Exercise**:
   - Task: Load, read, and manipulate a CSV file.
   - Example: Load student data from a CSV file, filter students based on their city, and calculate the average age.
