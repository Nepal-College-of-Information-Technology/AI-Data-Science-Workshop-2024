    "# Machine Learning Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the basic concepts of Machine Learning, including supervised vs unsupervised learning, and an overview of Scikit-learn.\n",

    "## 1. What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention. ML algorithms build a model based on training data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Examples of Machine Learning:\n",
    "- **Email Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "- **Movie Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting movies to users based on their preferences.\n",
    "- **Self-driving Cars**: Using image recognition and sensor data to navigate roads autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning:\n",
    "Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled data. This means that for each training example, the correct output is provided. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples of Supervised Learning**:\n",
    "  - Predicting house prices (regression).\n",
    "  - Classifying emails as spam or not spam (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without labels. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples of Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "  - Clustering customers based on purchasing behavior (clustering).\n",
    "  - Reducing the dimensionality of data for visualization (dimensionality reduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Overview of Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-learn** is a powerful Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Tools for data cleaning, scaling, and transforming.\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Includes Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**: Includes K-Means Clustering, PCA, etc.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, accuracy scoring, confusion matrix, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Scikit-learn:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install scikit-learn"
