# Day 12: AI in Cloud & Production

## Goal:
The goal of this session is to introduce students to cloud-based AI solutions and model deployment. By the end of this session, students will learn how to build simple AI applications using **Streamlit** and deploy them to cloud platforms such as **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render** for online access.

---

## Topics Covered:

### 1. **Introduction to Cloud-Based AI Solutions**:
   - Overview of AI services offered by **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Microsoft Azure**.
   - Discuss services like **Amazon SageMaker**, **Google Vertex AI**, and **Azure Machine Learning** for training and deploying machine learning models at scale.
   - Advantages of using cloud platforms for AI deployment (scalability, cost-efficiency, ease of deployment).

### 2. **Building a Simple AI Web App**:
   - Learn how to build AI applications using **Streamlit**, a Python framework for building web apps with simple and interactive user interfaces.
   - Example: Build a simple **Iris Flower Classifier** using a **RandomForestClassifier** in **Streamlit**.

### 3. **Deploying AI Apps to the Cloud**:
   - Learn how to deploy AI applications to the cloud using platforms like **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render**.
   - Deploy a **Streamlit** app to Hugging Face Spaces and obtain a public URL to share the deployed app.

## Notebooks:

1. **Part1_Cloud_AI_Solutions.ipynb**:
   - An introduction to cloud-based AI services, focusing on **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure**.
   - Learn the benefits of using cloud platforms for AI, such as scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of deployment.
   - Explore cloud AI solutions like **Amazon SageMaker**, **Google Vertex AI**, and **Azure Machine Learning**.

2. **Part2_Building_A_Streamlit_App.ipynb**:
   - A step-by-step guide to building a simple **Streamlit** app that classifies Iris flower species based on user input.
   - Deploy the app to **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render** for online access.
   - Obtain a public URL to share your app with others.

### Activity:

**Deploy an AI Web App**:
- Build a simple **Iris Flower Classifier** using **Streamlit**.
- Deploy the app to **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render** and obtain a public URL.
- Share the app with others and test the deployed model.
