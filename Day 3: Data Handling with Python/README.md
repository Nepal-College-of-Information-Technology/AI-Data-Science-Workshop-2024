### Assignment Guidelines:
- Access the assignment file from the [Pracitce Yourself](https://github.com/Nepal-College-of-Information-Technology/AI-Data-Science-Worksop-2024/blob/main/Practice%20Yourself).
  - Assignment_3.1_NumPy.ipynb
  - Assignment_3.2_Pandas.ipynb
- The file contains an "**Open in Colab**" link. Use this to open the assignment in Google Colab.
- Go to file menu at google colab and choose **Save a copy in Drive**
- Complete all the tasks provided in the assignment by replacing the `#code here` placeholders with working Python code.
- After completing the tasks, go to file menu and **download the ipynb file**
- Submit your assignment(the downloaded ipynb file) via the **GitHub Classroom** .
