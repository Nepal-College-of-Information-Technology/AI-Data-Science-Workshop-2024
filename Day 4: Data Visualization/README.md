## Topics Covered

1. **Matplotlib Basics**:
   - Introduction to Matplotlib.
   - Creating basic plots such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
   - Customizing plots with titles, labels, colors, and legends.

2. **Seaborn for Statistical Visualizations**:
   - Introduction to Seaborn.
   - Creating advanced statistical visualizations including:
     - Heatmaps,
     - Box Plots,
     - Pair Plots.

3. **Plotly for Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Introduction to Plotly for interactive web-based visualizations.
   - Creating interactive:
     - Line Plots,
     - Scatter Plots,
     - Pie Charts.

## Activities

1. **Matplotlib Practical Examples**:
   - Plot student exam scores using bar charts.
   - Visualize the population of Nepali cities using a bar chart.
   - Show temperature trends over a week in Kathmandu with a line plot.
   - Create a pie chart for student grade distribution.

2. **Seaborn and Plotly Examples**:
   - Use Seaborn to create heatmaps, box plots, and pair plots to explore datasets like the tips dataset.
   - Build interactive line plots and scatter plots with Plotly for visualizing relationships and trends.
   - Visualize categorical distributions with interactive pie charts using Plotly.
