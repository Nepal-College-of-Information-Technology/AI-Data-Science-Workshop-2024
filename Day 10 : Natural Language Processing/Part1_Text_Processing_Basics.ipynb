    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the basics of **Text Processing**, a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. We will cover key techniques like **tokenization**, **stemming**, **lemmatization**, and **stopwords removal**. These techniques help in preparing raw text data for analysis.\n",

    "## 1. What is Text Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Text processing refers to the steps involved in cleaning and preparing text data for further analysis. Raw text data often contains noise (e.g., punctuation, stopwords) and needs to be standardized before it can be used for tasks like **sentiment analysis**, **text classification**, or **machine translation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example:\n",
    "Consider you're analyzing customer reviews on an e-commerce platform. The raw text might contain slang, punctuation, or extra words that don't help with analysis. **Text processing** helps clean the text to focus on the important words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization** is the process of splitting text into smaller pieces called **tokens**. Tokens can be words, sentences, or even sub-words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Input: `\"I love natural language processing!\"`\n",
    "- Tokens: `[\"I\", \"love\", \"natural\", \"language\", \"processing\", \"!\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use **NLTK** to tokenize some text."
