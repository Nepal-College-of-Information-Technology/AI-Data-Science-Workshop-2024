2. **Introduction to Scikit-learn**:
   - Overview of Scikit-learn.
   - Features: preprocessing, model training, evaluation tools.

3. **Linear Regression**:
   - Simple Linear Regression explained.
   - Equation of Linear Regression.
   - Steps to implement Linear Regression in Scikit-learn.
   - Practical example: Predicting house prices based on area.

4. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**:
   - Explanation of the k-NN algorithm.
   - Steps to implement k-NN in Scikit-learn.
   - Practical example: Classifying flowers using the Iris dataset.

## Activities

1. **Linear Regression Activity**:
   - Students will implement a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on area.
   - They will split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.

2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Activity**:
   - Students will implement a k-NN classifier to classify flowers based on measurements (sepal length, petal width, etc.).
   - They will experiment with different values of k (number of neighbors) to see how it impacts the model's accuracy.
