# Day 2: Python Programming Basics

**Goal**: Build foundational Python skills essential for AI and Data Science.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Variables and Data Types**:
   - Overview of Python variables.
   - Data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
   - Mutability and immutability concepts.
   
2. **Functions**:
   - Defining and using functions.
   - Parameter passing and return values.
   - Local and global scope.

3. **Control Structures**:
   - If-else statements.
   - For and while loops.
   - Break, continue, and else in loops.

4. **Basic Input/Output**:
   - Taking input from the user.
   - Printing output.
   - Formatting strings.

5. **File Handling**:
   - Reading from and writing to files.
   - File modes (read, write, append).
   - Real-world examples: logging, saving user data, reading CSV files.
