# Day 9: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Goal:
The goal of this session is to introduce students to the basics of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and their application in **computer vision** tasks, specifically image classification. By the end of this session, students will be able to build and train a CNN on the **MNIST dataset** to classify handwritten digits.

## Topics Covered:

### 1. **Introduction to CNNs**:
   - What are **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**?
   - Key components of CNNs:
     - **Convolutional Layer**: Learn spatial features from images using filters (kernels).
     - **Pooling Layer**: Reduce the size of feature maps and preserve key information (e.g., max pooling).
     - **Fully Connected Layer**: Combine learned features to make predictions.
     - **Activation Function (ReLU)**: Introduce non-linearity to learn complex patterns.
   - How CNNs work for **image classification** tasks.

### 2. **Applications of CNNs**:
   - Image classification, object detection, facial recognition, medical imaging, and more.

### 3. **Building a CNN**:
   - Explanation of CNN architecture: convolutional layers, pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers.
   - Hands-on with building and training a CNN on the **MNIST dataset**.

### 4. **Hands-on Activity**:
   - Build, train, and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the MNIST dataset.
