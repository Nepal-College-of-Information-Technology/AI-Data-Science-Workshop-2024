    "# Introduction to Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy** (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Along with that, it offers a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays, making it an essential tool for scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data analysis, especially for cities like Kathmandu, Numpy can be incredibly useful for tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing temperature patterns across different times of the year.\n",
    "- Monitoring traffic data at various intersections to optimize traffic flow.\n",
    "- Processing large datasets related to pollution levels, population density, and many more.\n",
